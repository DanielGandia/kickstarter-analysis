# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
We were trying to analyze how some campaigns did compared to one another based on the Launch Date and the dollar amount of the Goals. The project was an effort to visualize such data in order to help Louise start Kickstarter preparations.

## Analysis and Challenges: 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Regarding the Outcomes for Plays, there weren't any months that had more Failed or Canceled kickstarters than Successful kickstarters. There was only one month (December) that there were more combined failed and canceled kickstarters than Successful.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The majority of the projects, a little over 90%, were launched with a goal of less than of $14,999 or less. Kickstarters with a lower goal did had a higher rate of success.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Some of the  challenges encountered were when I was creating the "Outcomes Based on Goal" worksheet and adding the formulas, specifically in the number of successful, failed and canceled because of the ranges. I had to modify each formula on each cell and it became a very time-consuming task yet not really difficult. My original Excel document was corrupted and I lost most of the data. Having to do this worksheet for a second time made me really learn the process. 
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? It appears to be best to launch a Kickstarter in the month of May, since this was the month with the most successfull outcomes. Another thing could be to avoid launching a Kickstarter during Nov-Jan because their is a higher rate of failure

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals? Kickstarters with a goal amount of less than $5,000 seem to have a higher success percentage that larger amounts, with the exception of the $35,000-$44,999 ranges that have the second best successful percentages.

- What are some limitations of this dataset? We had to add multiple columns in order the analyze some of the data provided. The columnes included Percentage Funded, Average Donation, Date Created and Date Ended Conversions. Also, had to split the category/subcategory to be able to filter by "plays". 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create? One possible graphs to create are Outcomes_vs_Goals per country. Also, by changing the subcategory to something other than plays, or using a parent category, you could potentially see how other kickstarters faired.
